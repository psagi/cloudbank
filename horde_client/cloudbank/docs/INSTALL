This document contains instructions for installing the Cloudbank Horde client


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Cloudbank **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Cloudbank runs within the `Horde Application Framework`, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde before
   installing Cloudbank.

   .. Important:: Cloudbank 0.1 requires version 3.0+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. `Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Cloudbank's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL` file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Cloudbank.


2. The following PECL modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL` for instructions on installing PECL modules)

   a. SCA_SDO

      SCA_SDO is required to communicate with the CloudBank server (via HTTP/SOAP)

3. A CloudBank server. See the RELEASE_NOTES for matching server and client versions.


Installing Cloudbank
===================

Cloudbank is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system. Conventionally, Cloudbank is installed directly underneath Horde in the
web server's document tree.

Since Cloudbank is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL. For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/cloudbank-horde-client-x.y.tar.gz
   mv cloudbank-horde-client-x.y cloudbank

and would then find Cloudbank at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/cloudbank/


Configuring Cloudbank
====================

1. Configuring Horde for Cloudbank

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['cloudbank']``
      stanza. The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired. If you have changed the location of Cloudbank relative
      to Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update
      the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

      If the ``applications['cloudbank']`` stanza is not existing (yet), create one similar to this:

      $this->applications['cloudbank'] = array(
	 'fileroot' => '/usr/share/horde3/lib' . '/../cloudbank',
	 'webroot' => $this->applications['horde']['webroot'] . '/cloudbank',
	 'name' => _("CloudBank client"),
	 'status' => 'active',
	 'menu_parent' => 'office'
      );

2. Configuring Cloudbank

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Cloudbank. Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to
   get to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration``
   icon to get the configuration page. Select ``Cloudbank Name`` from the
   selection list of applications. Fill in or change any configuration values
   as needed. When done click on ``Generate Cloudbank Name Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file. If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Cloudbank configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file. In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``cloudbank/config/conf.php``.

   You have to provide the base URL of your CloudBank server (the URL which gives access to the cloudbank-server/server directory).

3. Testing Cloudbank

   Use Cloudbank to list the Accounts. If it succeeds it means that you have proper connection to the CloudBank server.


Upgrading Cloudbank
===================

Go to the document root of the web server. For example, with the Apache web server's default document root of ``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde

Backup cloudbank/config/conf.php to somewhere outside the cloudbank directory.

   rm -rf cloudbank
   tar zxvf /path/to/cloudbank-horde-client-x.y.tar.gz
   mv cloudbank-horde-client-x.y cloudbank

Restore cloudbank/config/conf.php using the backup copy created before.


Known Problems
==============

Error messages are not displayed. In case of any (even user!) error a blank page appears. Please consult the web-server logs in such cases.
