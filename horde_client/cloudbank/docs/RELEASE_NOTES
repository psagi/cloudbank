The Horde Team is pleased to announce the release of the Cloudbank Application version H5 (0.10).

The Cloudbank Application is web client for the Cloudbank Server. It can be used for keeping track of personal finance matters. The incomes/expenses are organized into Accounts and Categories.
Cloudbank Horde Client v0.10 works with CloudBank Server v0.10 or above.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is not considered feature complete and there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. The localization feature is not expected to be working yet.
