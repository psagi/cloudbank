Installation instructions for CloudBank server
----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
   + HTTP server with PHP support
   + PHP command-line runtime (for installation)
   + SCA_SDO extension for PHP (available via PECL)

Steps:
   1. Create a suitable directory for the server, cd into it.
   2. tar xvzf cloudbank-server-x.y.tar.gz
   3. mv cloudbank-server.x.y cloudbank-server
   4. Create the database and a database user (if necessary for the specific DB engine) for cloudbank-server. The database has to be supported by PHP's PDO extension.
   5. Make sure that the database is accessible (rw) by the HTTP server (e.g. in case of sqlite3).
   6. cd cloudbank-server/conf
   7. cp cloudbank.ini.dist cloudbank.ini
   8. Configure the dsn and the username/password for the database in cloudbank.ini using you favourite text editor. If the chosen database engine does not need/have access control features (like e.g. sqlite3) provide some fake username/password.
   9. Configure the debug log file. If you do not use debugging, provide some fake path/filename.
   10. cd cloudbank-server
   11. install_server/create_schema.php
   12. Make the cloudbank-server/server directory accessible by the HTTP server. ATTENTION: Remember to properly secure the HTTP server setup. 

Test:
   wget <URL of the virtual dir>/EventService.php?wsdl
   This should download the WSDL for the EventService.
