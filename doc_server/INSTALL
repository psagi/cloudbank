Installation instructions for CloudBank server
----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
   + HTTP server with PHP support
   + PHP command-line runtime (for installation)
   + SCA_SDO extension for PHP (available via PECL)

Steps:
   1. Create a suitable directory for the server, cd into it.
   2. tar xvzf cloudbank-server-x.y.tar.gz
   3. mv cloudbank-server.x.y cloudbank-server
   4. Create the database and a database user (if necessary for the specific DB engine) for cloudbank-server. The database has to be supported by PHP's PDO extension.
   5. Make sure that the database is accessible by the HTTP server (e.g. in case of sqlite3).
   6. cd cloudbank-server/conf
   7. cp cloudbank.ini.dist cloudbank.ini
   8. Configure the dsn and the username/password for the database in cloudbank.ini using you favourite text editor. If the chosen database engine does not need/have access control features (like e.g. sqlite3) provide some fake username/password.
   9. Configure the debug log file. If you do not use debugging, provide some fake path/filename.
   10. cd cloudbank-server
   11. install_server/create_schema.php
   12. Make the cloudbank-server/server directory accessible by the HTTP server. ATTENTION: Remember to properly secure the HTTP server setup. 

Test:
   wget <URL of the virtual dir>/EventService.php?wsdl
   This should download the WSDL for the EventService.
