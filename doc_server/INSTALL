Installation instructions for CloudBank server
----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
   + HTTP server with PHP support
   + PHP command-line runtime (for installation)
   + SCA_SDO extension for PHP (available via PECL)
   + SQLite3

Steps:
   1. Create a suitable directory for the server, cd into it.
   2. tar xvzf cloudbank-server-x.y.tar.gz
   3. mv cloudbank-server.x.y cloudbank-server
   4. Create the SQLite3 database.
   5. Make sure that the database is accessible (rw) by the HTTP server.
   6. cd cloudbank-server/conf
   7. cp cloudbank.ini.dist cloudbank.ini
   8. Configure the dsn and the username/password for the database in cloudbank.ini using you favourite text editor. If the chosen database engine does not need/have access control features (like e.g. sqlite3) provide some fake username/password.
   9. Configure the debug log file. If you do not use debugging, provide some fake path/filename.
   10. cd cloudbank-server
   11. install_server/create_schema.php
   12. Make the cloudbank-server/server directory accessible by the HTTP server. ATTENTION: Remember to properly secure the HTTP server setup. 

Test:
   wget <URL of the virtual dir>/EventService.php?wsdl
   This should download the WSDL for the EventService.


Upgrade instructions for CloudBank server
----------------------------------------------

Steps:
   1. Backup cloudbank-server/conf/cloudbank.ini to somewhere outside cloudbank-server.
   2. Remove the previous CloudBank Server code: rm -rf cloudbank-server
   3. tar xvzf cloudbank-server-v.w.tar.gz
   4. mv cloudbank-server.v.w cloudbank-server
   5. Restore cloudbank-server/conf/cloudbank.ini using the backup copy created in step #1.
   6. If the database is not SQLite3, convert/migrate it. (From v0.4 on CloudBank server supports only SQLite3.)
   7. Make sure that the database is accessible (rw) by the HTTP server AND by the user doing the upgrade.
   8. cd cloudbank-server
   9. install_server/upgrade_schema_x_y-v_w.php

Basic testing can be done the same way as in case of first installation.
